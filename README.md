## Hello there! ✌🏻

My name is Amanda and I'm currently graduating in System Analysis and Development. 💻


**Talking about Personal Stuff:**
- 📍 My current areas of interest are mobile app development and web development. 
- 📚 I’m currently learning the following languages: CSS, HTML, Node.js and MySQL.

##
*NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages i have the most code on github, it's a new feature of [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)*
